    <h1>The rise of COVID-19 in New York State</h1>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused catastrophic effects for all. Communities were affected and had to act fast. COVID-19 tests were administered in order to track the number of cases, the positivity rate and more. New York State was one of the locations that monitored the data and the effects of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021. New York state governor Andrew Cuomo said “The entire country has been playing catch up with this virus since day one, but in New York we have been trying to plan forward and get ahead of the problem.”</p>
