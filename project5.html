                <span class="hugeLetter">D</span>uring the bustling hours of the day, members of Onondaga County turn to the various restaurants and food establishments to experience the diverse cuisines the county offers. Some hope to get a full dining experience while celebrating friends in town, graduations, birthdays, and anniversaries. Others rush into a Dunkin Donuts to grab their daily coffee or to a Chipotle during their lunch break. Restaurants are a crucial factor in our daily lives. Some people have even dedicated their time to creating social media pages advertising the best local pizzas, bakeries, and more. Although we get images of the food, photos of menus, and reviews, we don’t get access to the behind-the-scenes. Thankfully the New York State Department of Health does continuous inspections to guarantee the safety and health of food in preparation and presentation.

            <p class="paragraph">The Onondaga County has provided data on restaurant inspections that grant the public access to what restaurants have violations, both Critical and Non-critical. Now, you can check on your favorite restaurants to ensure that what you are consuming and where you are spending your money align with a safe and healthy environment. The data showcases the inspections from 2019-2023.
           
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">The Onondaga County Health Department inspects around 1,900 restaurants, which varies as restaurants open and close. The health department classifies the restaurants into three categories: high-risk level, medium-risk level, and low. 

            </p>


            <p class="paragraph">“We take a lot of guidelines from the New York State Health Department, and we strive to inspect all of our high-risk restaurants twice a year, our medium risk once a year, and low risk once every two years,” said Gretchen Pierson, Sanitarian III and Supervisor of Food Protection Section at the Onondaga County Health Department. On top of required inspections, Pierson’s team of inspectors will also respond to any restaurant complaints or emergencies that may occur at any given moment.

            </p>


             <p class="paragraph">High-risk restaurants are full-service restaurants that usually require a lot of preparation for the food (ex: raw food that they are cooking, cooling, or reheating). There are a lot of steps that create a greater chance of something going wrong. Examples of these restaurants are Alto Cinco and Rise N Shine Diner. Medium-risk restaurants are cook-and-serve establishments and tend to be fast-food restaurants. Examples are sub-shops or Mcdonald's. An example of low-risk restaurants is bar service restaurants or ice cream stands.

<p class="paragraph">This map shows the total violations by exact location of the restaurants in Onondaga County. The darker the color of the circles and the larger the circles show the restaurants with the most violations. The lighter the color and smaller the circle indicate restaurants with fewer violations.
             </p>

<p class="paragraph">The location with the most total violations was 900 Irving Ave, Syracuse, New York. This location had 15 total violations (both Critical and Non-critical). Many of these places are Syracuse affiliated dining areas which can be alarming for students and visitors of the campus to know that these places were inspected and found to have had food violations. Neporent Cafe, a dining hall on campus had 1 critical violation: “Food from unapproved source, spoiled, adulterated on premises” and 4 non-critical violations “Food not protected during storage, preparation, display, transportation and service, from potential sources of contamination (e.g., food uncovered, mislabeled, stored on floor)” Neporent Cafe was last inspected April 6, 2023 but has since corrected the total Critical Violation. Syracuse University Cuse Chicken Express had 1 Non-Critical violation: “Food not protected during storage, preparation, display, transportation and service, from potential sources of contamination (e.g., food uncovered, mislabeled, stored on floor)” that was last inspected 10/01/2022.

     </p>


<p class="paragraph">The second location with the total violations was 484 Salina Street. The coordinates are (43.044602, -76.152980) with 10 total violations (Critical and Non-critical). Some places include Firecracker Thai, which had 2 non-critical violations: “Food was not protected during storage, preparation, display, transportation, and service, from potential sources of contamination (e.g., food uncovered, mislabeled, stored on floor, food containers double stacked).” Firecracker Thai was last inspected on April 19th,2023. Salt City Coffee and Bar had 4 of the same non-critical violations as Firecracker Thai; it was last inspected on June 28th, 2023. Farm Girl Juicery had 1 Critical Violation: “Toxic chemicals are improperly labeled, stored or used so that contamination of food can occur,” and was last inspected on April 19th,2023. Big in Burma also received 1 Critical Violation: “Potentially hazardous foods are not stored under refrigeration except during necessary preparation or approved pre-cooling procedures,” which was last inspected on April 19th, 2023. Salina Street is another famous street that hosts many of Syracuse’s restaurants.

            <p class="paragraph">The pandemic also played a significant role in affecting the restaurant industry, many restaurants, unfortunately, had to shut down, and others went through financial losses but the resturant industry witnessed a 10% gain in new business openings from April 2022 to March 2023, in comparison to April 2021 to March 2022 according to Yelp.
            </p>

              <p class="paragraph">Looking into the resturant industry in Onondaga County, the bar chart below shows the total violations per month in 2022. October had the most violations with 52 violations in 2022.

            The  bar chart below shows the total violations by month and year from 2019-2023.  March 2023 had the most violations with 277.

             </p>


         <p class="paragraph">When noticing any patterns with violations, Pierson spoke on the different violations that occur during the seasons.

            </p>


        <p class="paragraph">“This time of year (the summer months), we will see a lot of temperature violations concerning refrigerators not working properly,” she said. “In the fall, fruit fly infestations and rodents occur, and in the early winter months, we see more foodborne illness with norovirus, which is  usually prevalent in the community.”

            </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Pierson, who has served for more than 20 years with the Onondaga County Health Department, believes the public must have access to the data concerning restaurant safety.

            </p>

        <p class="paragraph">“The public should know what they are at risk for,” she said. “Unfortunately, some places are unsafe for people to eat, and that's why we do our job. We want the public to be safe, and we don't want anyone to get sick.”
